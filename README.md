Welcome to my Habit tracker for the Iu International University of applied science for Data Science. 

1. Instalation
The programm requires Python 3.10 or above to run properly. 
To install the latest Python version go to https://www.python.org/downloads/source/ and install the version for your system

Open a Terminal session at the folder you downloaded the habit app. 
Check that the right Python version is running by typing "python --version". 
The response should be Python 3.10.X or above

Additionally pip is required to install additional packages. 
To install pip follow the instructions on https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

To complete the installation run pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all additional packages required for the app. 

2. Start the app
Open a Terminal session on the directory the app is stored. 
If you are on a Windows mashine make sure to use "cmd" and not a powershell. 
Start the app by typing "habit"
